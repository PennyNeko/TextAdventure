# TextAdventure:
A text adventure mini game created in swi-prolog. Just for clarification this is just a small program made for an assignement and mainly for fun, so it is not something big right now, but it may be expanded in the near future.

# Basic story:
There are strange things happening to the world, it seems like people are completely forgeting names and facts. There are people who no one seems to remember, but they are there, alive, but no one is paying attention to them. They call themselves "living ghosts". 

You will play as a character who wakes up after a hangover in the car, and notices all those strange things that suddenly started to happen.

# How to execute:
It can be executed in a swi-prolog compiler, by running the query ?- goto(gas_station). :)
